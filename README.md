# Employee-App

A simple app written in React. Allows you to understand how the state works, the properties of the component, the transfer of properties and methods through the hierarchy.
Counts the total number of employees dynamically. You can find an employee by letter, substring or string. If you click on the name of an employee, an asterisk will appear, which means that the employee will be promoted. You can delete an employee using the shopping cart button, add a new employee using the form, and also filter depending on the salary and the presence of an asterisk
